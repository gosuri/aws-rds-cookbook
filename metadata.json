  "long_description": "# AWS RDS cookbook\n\nThis cookbook provides libraries, resources and providers to configure and manage Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) with the EC2 API.\n\n# Requirements\n\nRequires Chef 0.7.10 or higher for Lightweight Resource and Provider support. Chef 0.8+ is recommended. \n\nAn Amazon Web Services account is required. The Access Key and Secret Access Key are used to authenticate with AWS.\n\n# Resources/Providers\n\nThe `aws_rds` LWRP manages a RDS instance\n\n## Actions\n\n- `:create`: creates a new RDS instance\n\n## Attribute Parameters\n\n- `allocated_storage`:  required - (Integer) The amount of storage (in gigabytes) to be initially allocated for the database instance.\n- `auto_minor_version_upgrade`: (Boolean) Indicates that minor engine upgrades will be applied automatically to the DB Instance during the maintenance window. Default: true\n- `availability_zone`: (String) The EC2 Availability Zone that the database instance will be created in.\n- `backup_retention_period`: (Integer) The number of days for which automated backups are retained. Setting this parameter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0 disables automated backups.\n- `character_set_name`: (String) For supported engines, indicates that the DB Instance should be associated with the specified CharacterSet.\n- `db_instance_class`: required - (String) The compute and memory capacity of the DB Instance.\n- `db_name`: (String) The name of the database to create when the DB Instance is created. If this parameter is not specified, no database is created in the DB Instance.\n- `db_parameter_group_name`: (String) The name of the database parameter group to associate with this DB instance. If this argument is omitted, the default DBParameterGroup for the specified engine will be used.\n- `db_security_groups`: (Array) A list of DB Security Groups to associate with this DB Instance.\n- `db_subnet_group_name`: (String) A DB Subnet Group to associate with this DB Instance. If there is no DB Subnet Group, then it is a non-VPC DB instance.\n- `engine`: required - (String) The name of the database engine to be used for this instance.\n- `engine_version`: (String) The version number of the database engine to use. Example: 5.1.42\n- `iops`: (Integer) The amount of provisioned input/output operations per second to be initially allocated for the database instance. Constraints: Must be an integer Type: Integer\n- `license_model`: (String) License model information for this DB Instance. Valid values: license-included | bring-your-own-license | general-public-license\n- `master_user_password`: required - (String) The password for the master DB Instance user.\n- `master_username`: required - (String) The name of master user for the client DB Instance.\n- `multi_az`: (Boolean) Specifies if the DB Instance is a Multi-AZ deployment. You cannot set the AvailabilityZone parameter if the MultiAZ parameter is set to true .\n- `option_group_name`: (String) Indicates that the DB Instance should be associated with the specified option group.\n- `port`: (Integer) The port number on which the database accepts connections.\n- `preferred_backup_window`: (String) The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled, as determined by the BackupRetentionPeriod.\n- `preferred_maintenance_window`: (String) The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can occur.\n- `publicly_accessible`: (Boolean) Specifies the accessibility options for the DB Instance. A value of true specifies an Internet-facing instance with a publicly resolvable DNS name, which resolves to a public IP address. A value of false specifies an internal instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether a VPC has been requested or not. The following list shows the default behavior in each case.\n- `tags`: (Array) A list of tags to associate with this DB Instance. For example [{:key => 'bod', :value => \"#{DateTime.now.to_s[0..18]}\"}\n- - Default VPC: true\n- - VPC: false If no DB subnet group has been specified as part of the request and the PubliclyAccessible value has not been set, the DB instance will be publicly accessible. If a specific DB subnet group has been specified as part of the request and the PubliclyAccessible value has not been set, the DB instance will be private.\n- `vpc_security_group_ids`: (Array) A list of Ec2 Vpc Security Groups to associate with this DB Instance. Default: The default Ec2 Vpc Security Group for the DB Subnet group's Vpc.\n\n# Usage\n\nIn `metadata.rb` you should declare a dependency on this cookbook. For example:\n\n```\ndepends 'aws-rds'\n```\n\nA recipe using this LWRP may look like this:\n\n```ruby\ndb_info = {\n  name:     'myappdb',\n  username: 'test_user',\n  password: 'test-password'\n}\n\n# Creates an instance with id 'myappdb'\n\naws_rds db_info[:name] do\n  # will use the iam role if available\n  # optionally place the keys\n  # see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSdkDocsRuby/latest/DeveloperGuide/ruby-dg-roles.html\n  # aws_access_key        'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY'\n  # aws_secret_access_key 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET'\n  engine                'postgres'\n  db_instance_class     'db.t1.micro'\n  allocated_storage     5\n  master_username       db_info[:username]\n  master_user_password  db_info[:password]\nend\n\n# Instance information will be available in the node object `node[:aws_rds]['myappdb']`\n# Since this attribute is set during the `execution` phase of the cookbook,\n# you'll need to use Lazy Attribute Evaluation to set the template variable during `execute` phase using `lazy` block\n\ntemplate \"/tmp/database.yml\" do\n  variables lazy {\n    {\n      host:     node[:aws_rds][db_info[:name]][:endpoint_address],\n      adapter:  'postgresql',\n      encoding: 'unicode',\n      database: db_info[:name],\n      username: db_info[:username],\n      password: db_info[:password]\n    }\n  }\nend\n```\n\nFor a more detailed example. See https://github.com/gosuri/rails-app-cookbook for a complete application using this cookbook\n\n# Attributes\n\n- aws_rds['aws_sdk_version']: `aws-sdk` RubyGem version. Default `1.11.1`\n\n# Recipes\n\n## default.rb\n\nThe default recipe installs the `aws-sdk` RubyGem, which this cookbook requires in order to work with the EC2 API. Make sure that the aws_rds recipe is in the node or role `run_list` before any resources from this cookbook are used.\n\n```\n\"run_list\": [\n  \"recipe[aws_sdk]\"\n]\n```\n\nThe `gem_package` is created as a Ruby Object and thus installed during the Compile Phase of the Chef run.\n\n# Contributing & Development\n\n## Development Requirements\n\n- Ruby 1.9.2+\n- AWS Account\n\n### Non-Gem Dependencies\n\n- Git\n- [Vagrant 1.3.5+](http://www.vagrantup.com)\n- [vagrant-berkshelf 1.3.4](https://github.com/berkshelf/vagrant-berkshelf): install using `vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf`\n- [vagrant-omnibus 1.1.2](https://github.com/schisamo/vagrant-omnibus): install using `vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus`\n\n### Runtime Rubygem Dependencies\n\nFirst you'll need bundler which can be installed with a simple `gem install bundler`. Afterwords, do the following:\n\n```\nbundle install\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Fork the project on github\n2. Commit your changes to your fork\n3.
