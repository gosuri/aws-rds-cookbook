# AWS RDS cookbook

This cookbook provides libraries, resources and providers to configure and manage Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) with the EC2 API.

# Requirements

Requires Chef 0.7.10 or higher for Lightweight Resource and Provider support. Chef 0.8+ is recommended. 

An Amazon Web Services account is required. The Access Key and Secret Access Key are used to authenticate with AWS.

# Resources/Providers

The `aws_rds` LWRP manages a RDS instance

## Actions

- `:create`: creates a new RDS instance

## Attribute Parameters

- `allocated_storage`:  required - (Integer) The amount of storage (in gigabytes) to be initially allocated for the database instance.
- `auto_minor_version_upgrade`: (Boolean) Indicates that minor engine upgrades will be applied automatically to the DB Instance during the maintenance window. Default: true
- `availability_zone`: (String) The EC2 Availability Zone that the database instance will be created in.
- `backup_retention_period`: (Integer) The number of days for which automated backups are retained. Setting this parameter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0 disables automated backups.
- `character_set_name`: (String) For supported engines, indicates that the DB Instance should be associated with the specified CharacterSet.
- `db_instance_class`: required - (String) The compute and memory capacity of the DB Instance.
- `db_name`: (String) The name of the database to create when the DB Instance is created. If this parameter is not specified, no database is created in the DB Instance.
- `db_parameter_group_name`: (String) The name of the database parameter group to associate with this DB instance. If this argument is omitted, the default DBParameterGroup for the specified engine will be used.
- `db_security_groups`: (Array) A list of DB Security Groups to associate with this DB Instance.
- `db_subnet_group_name`: (String) A DB Subnet Group to associate with this DB Instance. If there is no DB Subnet Group, then it is a non-VPC DB instance.
- `engine`: required - (String) The name of the database engine to be used for this instance.
- `engine_version`: (String) The version number of the database engine to use. Example: 5.1.42
- `iops`: (Integer) The amount of provisioned input/output operations per second to be initially allocated for the database instance. Constraints: Must be an integer Type: Integer
- `license_model`: (String) License model information for this DB Instance. Valid values: license-included | bring-your-own-license | general-public-license
- `master_user_password`: required - (String) The password for the master DB Instance user.
- `master_username`: required - (String) The name of master user for the client DB Instance.
- `multi_az`: (Boolean) Specifies if the DB Instance is a Multi-AZ deployment. You cannot set the AvailabilityZone parameter if the MultiAZ parameter is set to true .
- `option_group_name`: (String) Indicates that the DB Instance should be associated with the specified option group.
- `port`: (Integer) The port number on which the database accepts connections.
- `preferred_backup_window`: (String) The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled, as determined by the BackupRetentionPeriod.
- `preferred_maintenance_window`: (String) The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can occur.
- `publicly_accessible`: (Boolean) Specifies the accessibility options for the DB Instance. A value of true specifies an Internet-facing instance with a publicly resolvable DNS name, which resolves to a public IP address. A value of false specifies an internal instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether a VPC has been requested or not. The following list shows the default behavior in each case.
- `tags`: (Array) A list of tags to associate with this DB Instance. For example [{:key => 'bod', :value => "#{DateTime.now.to_s[0..18]}"}
- - Default VPC: true
- - VPC: false If no DB subnet group has been specified as part of the request and the PubliclyAccessible value has not been set, the DB instance will be publicly accessible. If a specific DB subnet group has been specified as part of the request and the PubliclyAccessible value has not been set, the DB instance will be private.
- `vpc_security_group_ids`: (Array) A list of Ec2 Vpc Security Groups to associate with this DB Instance. Default: The default Ec2 Vpc Security Group for the DB Subnet group's Vpc.

# Usage

In `metadata.rb` you should declare a dependency on this cookbook. For example:

```
depends 'aws_rds'
```

A recipe using this LWRP may look like this:

```ruby
db_info = {
  name:     'myappdb',
  username: 'test_user',
  password: 'test-password'
}

# Creates an instance with id 'myappdb'

aws_rds db_info[:name] do
  aws_access_key        'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY'
  aws_secret_access_key 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET'
  engine                'postgres'
  db_instance_class     'db.t1.micro'
  allocated_storage     5
  master_username       db_info[:username]
  master_user_password  db_info[:password]
end

# Instance information will be available in the node object `node[:aws_rds]['myappdb']`
# Since this attribute is set during the `execution` phase of the cookbook,
# you'll need to use Lazy Attribute Evaluation to set the template variable during `execute` phase using `lazy` block

template "/tmp/database.yml" do
  variables lazy {
    {
      host:     node[:aws_rds][db_info[:name]][:endpoint_address],
      adapter:  'postgresql',
      encoding: 'unicode',
      database: db_info[:name],
      username: db_info[:username],
      password: db_info[:password]
    }
  }
end
```

# Attributes

- aws_rds['aws_sdk_version']: `aws-sdk` RubyGem version. Default `1.11.1`

# Recipes

## default.rb

The default recipe installs the `aws-sdk` RubyGem, which this cookbook requires in order to work with the EC2 API. Make sure that the aws_rds recipe is in the node or role `run_list` before any resources from this cookbook are used.

```
"run_list": [
  "recipe[aws_sdk]"
]
```

The `gem_package` is created as a Ruby Object and thus installed during the Compile Phase of the Chef run.

# Contributing & Development

## Development Requirements

- Ruby 1.9.2+
